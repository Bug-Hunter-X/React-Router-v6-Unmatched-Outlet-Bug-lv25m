This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using React Router v6: an unmatched Outlet.  The bug showcases a scenario where nested routes fail to render their components. The solution provides a corrected version of the App component with the necessary adjustments to correctly render child routes within the Route hierarchy. The problem is due to an incorrect understanding or implementation of the Outlet component's role in defining nested route layouts within the React Router v6 architecture.
